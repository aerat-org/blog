A few days ago I wrote a post about Digital Scholarship workflows. I think that, while this is still the best workflow for scholarship, not the least of which is that you can run version contro on your acadimeic papers and workflows. 

I think that some addidional conext and stipulations are necessary to fully elucidate my position on the matter. The workflow that I proposed is fantastic for many-person academic projects. However, it is certainly optimized for Digital Publishing. Say, for instance, that you were creating a textbook that would be optimized for epub or pdf format. You could use a tool such as [Quarto](quarto.org) to structure, write, and publish your content. Quarto is what I will call "the engine" for the purpose of this article, but in truth it could be something like hugo, jupyterbook, or quire. Each of these engines are optimized for different content. Hugo for static site generation, quire for high-resolution image formats, hugo and jupyterbook for code execution online. It is my belief that before one begins writing content or choosing an engine, they should consider what features they wish their project to implement. An art historian may choose something like quire due to it's focus on quality image rendering. But a data scientist may instead choose quarto because of its ability to render `.md`, `.rmd`, or `.ipynb` and run code in-browser.
