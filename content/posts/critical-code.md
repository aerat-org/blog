## Introduction

I tend to write a lot of digital files, be it python, rust, markdown, or latex. But first and foremost, I am/was a student of the humanities, and specifically philosophy, and most specifically, critical theory. Before maybe a few months ago, I separated these two practices in my head with a very high wall, assuming that they were too dissimilar to be reconciled synthesized theoretically. Recently though, I have been reading a lot of work on critical code studies, and have been thinking of ways to support the practice of code studies in the humanities and sciences as a librarian. 

As librarians, we have a tendency to preserve *everything*, but oddly, we don't preserve code. I think that this is because librarians, especially those in the humanities, distrust those who code, as there is a tendency in the sciences to *fetishize* code. [^1] This post is not going to be an indictment of either humanities or sciences scholars, but rather how we librarians can better support the practice of writing code and the critical study thereof. Let us begin with GitHub, a software hosting tool that is built on the Git version control system. While this is a great tool for software development, it is not a great use for long-term hosting. If Microsoft kills it, all the code dies. We need to be able to preserve code in way that is findable, not just for the development of code, but also as a practice of history. Code, I argue, is a historical artifact, representing the cultural context of the time and place it was written, we need to have a way to preserve it. We do not know what will be regarded as important for future historians, we can only preserve what we have and hope that it is enough. If I were to place bets on institutions that will exist in the United States by the year 2323, I would bet on The Library of Congress or some of the larger universities. I would not bet on GitHub, or even Microsoft. Therefore, we need a way to store code that is not dependent on a single institution.
