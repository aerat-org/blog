## Introduction

academic publishing is important for sharing your work
establishing a system that minimizes friction and maximizes synergy
version control is useful for tracking progress

## Viewpoint Two: Collaborative Workflows are Simple

- Using word with some kind of drive/dropbox/etc.
- Why word works for some people

## A Robust Workflow for Scholarly Publishing

Scholarship is a collaborative and iterative process, where small changes build up over time to create a final product. Further, we should strive to make our research process as open and transparent as possible. The workflow I propose as a solution to these problems is a workflow that prioritizes open source tools, version control, and reproducibility.  

This article describes a collaborative scholarly workflow for digital-first publishing. There are several elements of this workflow, below is a list of how they fit together.

- File Format: Markdown
- Version Control: Git
- Hosting: GitHub
- Citation Management: Zotero
- Text Editor: VS Code
- Conversion: Pandoc

## "Quick" Start

### Software Downloads

1. Zotero
   1. Better BibTex - Zotero plugin that allows for better citation management
2. VSCode
   1. Pandoc Citer - VSCode Extension that will allow us to cite in Markdown easily
   2. Pandoc Render - VSCode extension that allows for a reproducible pandoc rendering command, will allow for a faster way to render documents

#### Creating a new project

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Clone the empty repository to your local machine
3. Create a folder for each author on the project such that the folder structure looks like this:

```
project
├── author1
│   ├── author1_content.md
├── author2
│   ├── author2_content.md
```

#### Autoexporting .bib file

1. Create a .bib file in the root directory of your project
2. Configure Better BibTex to export to this .bib file
3. Enable automatic export

Now you can add citations from the zotero browser plugin, and they will automatically be added to your .bib file.

Now, if you are author1, your folder structure should look like this:

```
project
├── author1
│   ├── author1_content.md
│   ├── author1.bib
├── author2
│   ├── author2_content.md
```

Author2 will set up their own sources on their own machine, and will have their own .bib file.

#### Setting up VSCode

Now, we want to start writing, to do this, open VSCode.

#### Setting up Zotero and Better Bibtex

Follow the instructions for installing Better Bibtex here: [Link](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)




Open the pandoc citer settings, and have the .bib file point to wherever your .bib file is stored.

### Zotero Setup

1. Install Zotero
2. Create a new library for your project
3. Install the Better BibTex plugin
4. Configure Better BibTex to export to a .bib file in your project's root directory, enable automatic export
5. Add a .csl file to your project's root directory

### Extension Setup

1. Install the Pandoc Citer extension
2. Configure the extension to use the .bib and .csl files in your project's root directory
3. Configure the extension to use the citation style you want
4. Configure the extension to use the citation key format you want

### Workspace Setup

You can use an automation script that I created in bash for you to set up your workspaces. You can find it here: [Link](https://github.com/aerithnetzer/auto-scholar)

- Something like google docs is not a good solution because it does not allow for blame.

## Can you have both?
